    <p>
    Recall that in Part 1, one of the 25 decision rounds would be selected at random.
    A ball numbered from 1 to 100 would be drawn virtually, and we will use that
    ball number, and the option you chose in the selected decision round, to determine
    your earnings for Part 1.
    </p>
    <p>
    On the next page, we will recap the 25 options you chose, and then determine
    your Part 1 earnings.
