    <p>
    For our study, it is helpful to know a bit more about our participants.
    Below we ask a few general questions about you and your background.
    Remember that as with all decisions in today’s experiment, any information you choose to give is recorded anonymously,
    and will only be used in the analysis of the data from this experiment.
