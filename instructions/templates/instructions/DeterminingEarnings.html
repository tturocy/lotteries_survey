Part 1: Determining your earnings

    <p>
    At the end of the experiment, one decision round will be chosen at
        random of the 25 rounds to determine your earnings for the experiment.
        Each round is equally likely to be chosen.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because you will not know in advance which round will be chosen,
        you should treat each round as if it is the one which will determine your earnings.
