        To select the option you prefer, click on the picture of the corresponding
        horizontal bar.  When you do, that option will be highlighted on your
        screen.  If you change your mind, you can click the other option instead;
        that option will then be highlighted.  You can revise your choice as often
        as you would like.  When you are satisfied with your choice, click the
        button labeled <b>Confirm decision</b>, which will record your decision and
        move you to the next decision round.
