    <p>
    Welcome to todayâ€™s experiment and thanks for coming.
        This is an experiment in the economics of decision-making.
        If you follow the instructions, complete the experiment and make appropriate decisions,
        you can earn an appreciable amount of money.
        This will be paid to you via bank transfer within the next few days.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have any questions, or need assistance of any kind, please ask your question
        using the Q&amp;A facility provided in Zoom.
        Any questions asked in the Q&amp;A will be seen only by the experimenter.
    </p>
    <p>
        All decisions in today's experiment and any information you choose to give is
        recorded anonymously, and will only be used in the analysis of the data from this experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
        There will be two parts to today's experiment.
        We will describe Part 1 now; once Part 1 has been completed we will
        go on to describe Part 2.
        Your total earnings from today's experiment will be the sum of your
        earnings from the two parts.
    </p>
