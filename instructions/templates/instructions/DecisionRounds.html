Part 1: A typical decision round
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}

    <p>
    In each decision round, you will have a choice between two options.
    Here is an example of how a typical decision round will look:
    </p>

    <div class="container p-2 mb-2 border">
        {% include "global/DecisionTableau.html" %}
    </div>

    {% if session.config.show_expected and session.config.show_risk %}
    <p>
    To the right of each horizontal bar are two columns.
    </p>
        The first column is labelled <b>Average returns</b>.
        You can think of this as the amount you would earn
        if we were to do a large number of random draws,
        and compute the average earnings per draw.
        Remember however that your earnings from the option
        you choose will be determined by a single draw only.
    </p>
    <p>
        The second column is labelled <b>Risk</b>.
        This shows the standard deviation, which is a measure
        of how spread out the earnings are.  The earnings from
        an option with a higher standard deviation are more variable
        than the earnings from an option with a lower standard deviation.
    </p>
        <p>
            If you wish to refer to these definitions while making your decisions,
            the <b>Average returns</b> and <b>Risk</b> labels have popups which
            display when your mouse pointer is over them.  Try it out now to see how this
            works.
        </p>
    {% elif session.config.show_expected %}
    <p>
    To the right of the horizontal bar showing the amounts you would earn
        for each possible draw is a column labelled Average Returns.
        You can think of this as the amount you would earn if we were
        to do a large number of random draws, and compute the average earnings per draw.

        will be determined by a single draw only.

        </p>
    {% elif session.config.show_risk %}
    <p>

        earn for each possible draw is a column labelled Risk.
        This shows the standard deviation, which is a measure
        of how spread out the earnings are.  The earnings from an
        option with a higher standard deviation are more variable
        than the earnings from an option with a lower standard deviation.

            If you wish to refer to this definition while making your decisions,
            the <b>Risk/b> label has a popup which
            displays when your mouse pointer is over it.  Try it out now to see how this
            works.
