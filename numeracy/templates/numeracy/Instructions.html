    <p>
    Part 1 of the experiment is now complete, and we will now describe Part 2.
    </p>
    <p>
    In Part 2, we will ask you a series of questions about some calculations that
        arise in everyday life.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will earn <span class="font-weight-bold">£1.00</span> for each question
        you answer correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
        In other words, your total earnings from Part 2 of the experiment will be
        determined by counting up the number of questions you answer correctly in Part 2,
        and multiplying by £1.00.
